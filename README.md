# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis
The problem I will be working on is customer churn. I’ll be using a fictitious churn dataset from a Telecom provider and my task is to analyse why customers are churning.
The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity.” 
dataset consists of 29 different columns and has one row per customer. I’ll be analyzing a snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time, meaning there is no time dimension. The dataset contains numerous dimensions, the first one being Customer_id.

The Customer_id is a unique ID that identifies an individual customer.
The second column is called Churn Label, and it indicates if a customer churned with “Yes” and “No” labels. The dataset contains various other dimensions, such as demographic fields and information about premium plans.
The dataset contains more than just dimensions. The Total Charges column, for example, takes the sum of all monthly charges billed to a customer.
